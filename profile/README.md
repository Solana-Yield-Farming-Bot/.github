## About

The **Solana Yield Farming Bot** is a research- and production-oriented toolkit that automates yield farming workflows on Solana, with a primary integration for **Raydium** liquidity pools and AMM routes. The application is intended to assist users who wish to identify promising farming opportunities, evaluate risk metrics (impermanent loss, TVL, volatility, fees), and automate the operational tasks required to farm yield â€” deposit, monitor, harvest, and withdraw â€” while enforcing configurable safety policies.

This repository contains documentation, architecture guidance, simulation/backtest tools, and a Windows installer (download link above). It is designed for self-hosted operation, with best-practice patterns for key management, signing, and auditability. The project emphasizes transparency, safety, and legal compliance.

**Important legal & security notes:**

- Do **not** paste private keys into untrusted UIs or third-party websites. Prefer wallet providers, hardware wallets, or remote signing services that keep keys off the host.
- Test thoroughly on devnets or with disposable wallets (minimal funding) before using production funds.
- Yield farming and DeFi carry financial risk. This tool is not financial advice. Users are responsible for complying with local laws and protocol terms.
- The project forbids code or instructions that facilitate market manipulation, front-running, or other illegal activity.

## Main features

- **Raydium-first integration** â€” curated connectors for Raydium pools, farms, and AMM routes.
- **Pool discovery & ranking** â€” automated scanning and ranking of pools by APY, TVL, fee structure, slippage sensitivity, and recent volume.
- **Risk analysis engine** â€” impermanent loss estimation, volatility measurements, rug/pair risk flags, token audit metadata integration.
- **Automated deposit & withdrawal workflows** â€” configurable strategies to deposit into pools, harvest rewards, reinvest or withdraw according to rules.
- **Strategy templates** â€” ready-to-run, configurable strategies (conservative, balanced, aggressive) with parameter presets.
- **Backtesting & simulation** â€” replay historic pool data and simulate farming outcomes under slippage and fee models.
- **Paper trading mode** â€” full end-to-end simulation that mirrors on-chain events without touching real funds.
- **Secure signing recommendations** â€” wallet-adapter patterns, hardware wallet support, and remote signer references (no plaintext private-key usage).
- **Transaction safety checks** â€” pre-flight checks, estimated gas/fee caps, slippage thresholds, and emergency stop.
- **Observability & logs** â€” structured audit trails, transaction receipts, and event logs for each action.
- **Notifications & alerts** â€” configurable alerts for fills, harvests, breaches of risk thresholds, and scheduled operations.
- **Scheduler & maintenance** â€” periodic harvest schedules, auto-compounding options, and maintenance windows.
- **Plugin architecture** â€” add connectors for other Solana AMMs and DEXs without changing core logic.
- **Config-driven operation** â€” all strategy parameters live in versioned, auditable config templates (no secrets stored).
- **Access controls** â€” role separation for operators, reviewers, and auditors in team deployments.

## How it works (high level)

This section explains the conceptual pipeline that the bot uses to find, evaluate, and manage yield farming positions on Raydium.

1. **Market scan & discovery**  
   - The bot queries Solana RPCs, on-chain pool metadata, and off-chain indicators (volume, token data) to build a candidate pool list.
   - Filters exclude low-liquidity, new/unverified tokens, and flagged token contracts.

2. **Risk & APY estimation**  
   - For each candidate pool the engine computes projected APY, impermanent loss estimate over historic volatility, pool concentration, and reward token emissions.
   - Pools are scored across multiple axes and assigned a recommended allocation.

3. **Strategy decision & allocation**  
   - Based on selected strategy template, the allocation manager determines how much capital to allocate to each pool, respecting per-pool and global caps, max drawdown limits, and user-specified exposure constraints.

4. **Pre-flight safety checks**  
   - Before any on-chain action: slippage check, fee cap check, token audit/whitelist, and multi-source RPC availability. If any check fails, the operation is halted and an alert is emitted.

5. **Signing & execution**  
   - The execution manager prepares transactions. Signing is performed using one of the secure options: external wallet provider, hardware wallet, or remote signer. The system never recommends pasting private keys into the GUI.
   - Transactions are submitted, monitored for confirmation, and receipts are recorded.

6. **Monitoring & rebalancing**  
   - The bot continuously monitors pool health and positions. When thresholds are breached (e.g., impermanent loss risk increases, TVL drops, token price anomalies), it triggers rebalancing, harvesting, or withdrawal based on user rules.

7. **Harvesting & compounding**  
   - Rewards are harvested on schedule or opportunistically, fees and gas are estimated, rewards can be auto-sold, re-pooled, or transferred according to strategy.

8. **Reconciliation & audit**  
   - All actions are reconciled against on-chain state and recorded for auditing and reporting purposes.

## Security & best practices

- **Never expose private keys.** Use wallet adapters (e.g., Phantom wallet provider patterns), hardware wallets, or remote signing services. The recommended pattern separates the signing device from the host running the bot.
- **Prefer read-only RPCs for discovery.** Only use write-enabled RPCs for execution and with proper rate limiting.
- **Use ephemeral or small-test wallets for initial trials.** Fund with minimal token amounts to validate automation flows.
- **Harden your host.** Run the bot on a secured server with firewall rules, limited network exposure, and OS-level hardening.
- **Keep software up to date.** Regularly update dependencies and monitor security advisories for Solana and Raydium.
- **Enable multi-signer approvals for production.** Consider out-of-band approvals (email/2FA or multisig) for high-value operations.
- **Maintain immutable logs.** Store operation logs and receipts off the host (S3, secure archival) for accountability.

## Risk disclosure

Yield farming introduces unique risks beyond market volatility:

- Impermanent loss relative to HODLing.
- Smart contract or pool vulnerabilities.
- Token rug pulls or malicious token contracts.
- Price or oracle manipulation impacting LP valuation.
- Network congestion leading to failed transactions or missed harvests.

Use conservative default settings, enable automatic stop conditions, and maintain a tested withdrawal plan.

## Testing & rollout checklist

1. Run unit tests and static code analysis locally.
2. Backtest your chosen strategy across multiple historical regimes.
3. Run in paper trading mode against live feeds.
4. Trial with an ephemeral wallet funded with a small amount.
5. Use hardware wallet or remote signer in a controlled pilot.
6. Gradually scale allocations with monitoring and alerts enabled.
